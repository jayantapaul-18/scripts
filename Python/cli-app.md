To create a Python CLI application that allows dropdown-like options for selecting operations, running scripts constantly in the background, and accepting commands anytime, you can use a combination of libraries:

1. **`click`**: For building the CLI interface.
2. **`InquirerPy`**: For dropdown-like selection (similar to Inquirer.js in Node.js).
3. **`threading`**: To run scripts in the background.
4. **`signal`**: For handling command interruptions gracefully.

Hereâ€™s a basic outline for a Python CLI application that can run scripts in the background and accepts commands at any time:

### Step 1: Install required libraries

```bash
pip install click InquirerPy
```

### Step 2: Create the Python CLI application

```python
import click
import threading
import time
import signal
from InquirerPy import inquirer

# Global variable to control the background task
stop_thread = False

# Function to run background tasks
def run_background_task():
    while not stop_thread:
        print("Running background task...")
        time.sleep(5)

# Handle command interruption (e.g., Ctrl + C)
def handle_exit(signal_num, frame):
    global stop_thread
    print("Stopping background task...")
    stop_thread = True
    exit(0)

# Set up signal handler
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handle_exit)

# CLI command for dropdown options
@click.command()
def cli():
    # Start background task in a separate thread
    background_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_background_task)
    background_thread.start()

    while True:
        # Dropdown-like menu using InquirerPy
        choice = inquirer.select(
            message="Select an operation:",
            choices=[
                "Run Script 1",
                "Run Script 2",
                "Stop background task",
                "Exit",
            ],
        ).execute()

        # Perform different operations based on the selection
        if choice == "Run Script 1":
            print("Executing Script 1...")
            # Simulate running a script
            time.sleep(2)
            print("Script 1 completed.")
        
        elif choice == "Run Script 2":
            print("Executing Script 2...")
            # Simulate running a script
            time.sleep(3)
            print("Script 2 completed.")

        elif choice == "Stop background task":
            global stop_thread
            stop_thread = True
            print("Background task stopped.")

        elif choice == "Exit":
            print("Exiting CLI.")
            stop_thread = True
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Background Task**: The function `run_background_task()` simulates a task that runs continuously in the background using a separate thread. You can replace this with any logic you need.
  
2. **Signal Handling**: The `signal` module is used to catch `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and cleanly stop the background task.

3. **Dropdown Selection**: `InquirerPy` is used to present a dropdown-style menu in the terminal. It offers different options to run scripts or stop the background task.

4. **Threading**: The `threading` module runs the background task concurrently while allowing the CLI to accept user input.

### Running the Application

1. Save this script as `cli_app.py`.
2. Make it executable by running:

   ```bash
   chmod +x cli_app.py
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python cli_app.py
   ```

The application will continuously run a background task, while you can interact with it using the dropdown options. You can stop the task or exit the program at any time.
