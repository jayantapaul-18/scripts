To create a Python CLI command that you can run from anywhere in your terminal (such as by typing `sre`), you need to:

1. Package your Python script as an executable command.
2. Add this command to your system’s PATH, so it’s globally available.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve that.

### Step 1: Modify the Python Script

First, ensure your script has a proper "shebang" line at the top, so it knows to use Python when executed directly.

1. Add the following shebang line at the top of your Python file (`cli_app.py`):

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```

   This makes sure the script runs using the `python3` interpreter.

2. Save the modified file.

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

To allow the script to be run as a command, you need to make it executable:

1. Run the following command in the terminal to give execution permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/your/cli_app.py
   ```

2. Optionally, rename the file to `sre` if that’s the command you want to use:

   ```bash
   mv /path/to/your/cli_app.py /path/to/your/sre
   ```

### Step 3: Add the Script to Your PATH

To run the `sre` command from anywhere in the terminal, the script needs to be located in a directory that is part of your system’s `PATH`. Here’s how you can add it:

1. **Move the script to a directory in your `PATH`** (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):

   ```bash
   sudo mv /path/to/your/sre /usr/local/bin/sre
   ```

2. **Alternatively**, you can add the current script directory to your `PATH`. To do this, edit your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc., depending on your shell) and add the script’s directory to your `PATH`:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/script_directory
   ```

3. After modifying the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, run this to reload the file:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash users
   source ~/.zshrc   # For Zsh users
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Command

Once you've moved the script to a `PATH` directory or added its location to `PATH`, you can test the `sre` command by typing:

```bash
sre
```

This should invoke your Python CLI without needing to specify the script’s path.

### Optional: Packaging with `setuptools`

If you want to package your CLI script more formally, you can use `setuptools` to create a proper Python package with an entry point.

1. Create the following directory structure:

   ```
   my_cli_tool/
   ├── cli_app.py
   └── setup.py
   ```

2. Write the `setup.py` file:

   ```python
   from setuptools import setup

   setup(
       name='sre-cli',
       version='1.0',
       py_modules=['cli_app'],
       entry_points={
           'console_scripts': [
               'sre=cli_app:cli',
           ],
       },
   )
   ```

   Here, the `console_scripts` entry point defines `sre` as the command, which will call the `cli()` function in `cli_app.py`.

3. Install the package using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

Now, `sre` will be available as a globally accessible command.
