 * Will enable me to drive systemic improvements in how we build and operate services, fostering a stronger culture of reliability and reducing operational toil across engineering.
 * Contributes to achieving key business objectives by ensuring the underlying platform and services meet demanding availability and performance targets.
3. Success Measures:
 * Successfully design and lead the implementation of at least 2 major initiatives demonstrably improving reliability, scalability, observability, or automation across multiple services (e.g., measurable improvement in key SLOs, reduction in Sev1/Sev2 incidents, improved MTTR/MTTD, reduction in toil).
 * Receiving consistent feedback from peers (SRE/SWE), leadership, and mentees indicating operation at the Principal SRE level, particularly in areas of technical leadership, strategic thinking for reliability, and cross-functional influence.
 * Tangible contributions to the organization's SRE strategy, tooling roadmap, or architectural patterns for reliability and operability.
 * Recognition as a go-to expert in specific SRE domains (e.g., large-scale Kubernetes operations, distributed tracing implementation, chaos engineering practices, performance tuning under load).
 * Successfully acting as Incident Commander or key technical lead during complex, multi-system incidents, followed by driving impactful postmortem actions.
 * Meeting the defined competencies and expectations outlined in the company's Principal SRE leveling guide.
 * Manager assessment confirms readiness for promotion consideration.
4. Support Needed:
 * Mentorship from a current Principal/Distinguished SRE or senior Infrastructure leader.
 * Opportunities to lead design and implementation of large-scale reliability projects impacting multiple teams/services.
 * Involvement in architectural review processes, particularly for new critical services.
 * Opportunities to lead major incident response and postmortem analysis.
 * Exposure to strategic planning related to infrastructure, tooling, and operational practices.
 * Support for attending relevant SRE/Cloud/Observability conferences (e.g., SREcon, KubeCon, Monitorama) or advanced training.
 * Constructive feedback from manager, peers, and development teams on SRE practices and leadership.
