To monitor AWS IAM role creation events using Python, you can use AWS CloudTrail to track these events and then set up an AWS Lambda function to process and notify you about new role creations. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Set Up CloudTrail
Create a CloudTrail Trail:
Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.
Click on "Trails" and then "Create trail."
Enter a trail name, configure your settings, and choose a storage location.
Make sure to enable "Read/Write events" and select "iam.amazonaws.com" under "Event sources."
Click "Create trail."
Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket for Lambda Deployment Package (Optional)
If you plan to deploy your Python script as an AWS Lambda function, you can create an S3 bucket to store the deployment package.

Go to the AWS S3 service.
Create a new bucket and note down the bucket name.
Step 3: Create Lambda Function
Create a Lambda Execution Role:

Go to the AWS IAM service.
Create a new IAM role with the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AWSLambdaRole policies attached.
Create a Python Script:
Below is a simple Python script (lambda_function.py) that sends a notification when an IAM role is created. This example uses the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and the AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS).

python
Copy code
import json
import boto3

sns_topic_arn = 'YOUR_SNS_TOPIC_ARN'
sns_client = boto3.client('sns')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        if record['eventName'] == 'CreateRole':
            role_arn = record['responseElements']['role']['arn']
            message = f"IAM Role Created: {role_arn}"
            sns_client.publish(TopicArn=sns_topic_arn, Message=message)
Replace 'YOUR_SNS_TOPIC_ARN' with the actual ARN of your SNS topic.

Deploy the Lambda Function:

Zip your Python script and any dependencies (e.g., boto3) into a deployment package.
If you created an S3 bucket, upload the deployment package to the bucket.
Go to the AWS Lambda service.
Create a new function.
Upload the deployment package (or reference the S3 location).
Set the handler to lambda_function.lambda_handler.
Configure the function to use the IAM role you created earlier.
Set Up SNS Topic:

Create an SNS topic in the AWS SNS service.
Subscribe your desired notification endpoint (e.g., email, SMS) to the SNS topic.
Step 4: Test
Create a new IAM role using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or an SDK. This should trigger the Lambda function, and you should receive a notification.

Please note that the actual IAM role creation details might be nested differently in the CloudTrail event payload. Adjust the script accordingly based on the structure of the events in your CloudTrail logs.
