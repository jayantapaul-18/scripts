Here are some of the top complex Python programming techniques and advanced shortcuts to help you write more efficient, compact, and readable code.

### **1. List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions**

#### **1.1 List Comprehensions**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They can replace traditional `for` loops to create lists more compactly.

```python
# Traditional approach
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

# List comprehension
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

#### **1.2 Generator Expressions**

Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions, but they don't store the whole list in memory; instead, they generate items one by one, which is memory-efficient.

```python
# Generator expression
squares_gen = (i ** 2 for i in range(10))

# Convert generator to a list or iterate directly
print(list(squares_gen))  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

### **2. Decorators for Code Reusability and Logging**

Decorators allow you to modify the behavior of a function or method. They are a powerful tool for implementing cross-cutting concerns such as logging, access control, and caching.

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    """Decorator to measure execution time of a function."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute():
    sum_ = sum(i for i in range(1000000))
    return sum_

print(compute())  # Output: Function compute executed in 0.0450 seconds
```

### **3. Context Managers for Resource Management**

Context managers are used to properly manage resources like files or network connections, ensuring they are properly acquired and released.

#### **3.1 Using the `with` Statement**

The `with` statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks.

```python
# Traditional way of opening and closing a file
file = open("example.txt", "r")
try:
    content = file.read()
finally:
    file.close()

# Using context manager with 'with' statement
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()  # File automatically closed after this block
```

#### **3.2 Creating Custom Context Managers**

You can create custom context managers using the `contextlib` module or by defining a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(file, mode):
    try:
        f = open(file, mode)
        yield f
    finally:
        f.close()

with open_file('example.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
```

### **4. Using `collections` Module for Advanced Data Structures**

The `collections` module provides specialized data structures like `deque`, `Counter`, `namedtuple`, and `defaultdict`.

#### **4.1 `namedtuple`**

`namedtuple` is an easy way to create a lightweight object type with named fields.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Defining a namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
p = Point(1, 2)
print(p.x, p.y)  # Output: 1 2
```

#### **4.2 `defaultdict`**

`defaultdict` provides a default value for the dictionary that avoids key errors.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(int)
d['apple'] += 1
print(d['apple'])  # Output: 1
print(d['banana'])  # Output: 0 (default value)
```

### **5. Advanced Use of `itertools` for Iteration**

The `itertools` module provides advanced tools for handling iterators.

#### **5.1 `combinations`, `permutations`, and `product`**

Generate all possible combinations, permutations, or cartesian products.

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations, product

data = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate all combinations of 2 elements
print(list(combinations(data, 2)))  # Output: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]

# Generate all permutations of 2 elements
print(list(permutations(data, 2)))  # Output: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)]

# Generate cartesian product
print(list(product(data, repeat=2)))  # Output: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
```

### **6. Use `functools` for Function Manipulation**

The `functools` module allows you to manipulate functions in advanced ways.

#### **6.1 `lru_cache` for Caching**

Use `lru_cache` to cache the results of expensive function calls to speed up repeated calculations.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(30))  # Cached results improve performance
```

#### **6.2 `partial` for Pre-Filled Functions**

Use `partial` to create new versions of functions with some arguments pre-filled.

```python
from functools import partial

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Create a new function that multiplies by 2
double = partial(multiply, 2)
print(double(5))  # Output: 10
```

### **7. Handling Exceptions Like a Pro**

Use advanced exception handling to provide more robust and informative error messages.

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("This will always execute, regardless of an error.")
```

### **8. Using `dataclasses` for Cleaner Classes**

`dataclasses` provide a way to create classes with less boilerplate code.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: int
    active: bool = True

user = User(name="Alice", age=30)
print(user)  # Output: User(name='Alice', age=30, active=True)
```

### **9. F-Strings for Efficient String Formatting**

Python 3.6+ introduced **f-strings** for better readability and performance in string formatting.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

### **10. Ternary Conditional Expressions**

Use ternary conditional expressions for concise conditional logic.

```python
# Traditional if-else
age = 18
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)  # Output: Adult
```

### **11. Contextual `with` Statements for Multiple Resources**

You can use multiple resources in a single `with` statement.

```python
with open('file1.txt', 'r') as file1, open('file2.txt', 'w') as file2:
    data = file1.read()
    file2.write(data)
```

### **12. Use `zip` for Parallel Iteration**

`zip` can be used to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]

for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")  # Output: Alice is 25 years old, etc.
```

### **13. Combining Multiple Techniques: Efficient Data Processing**

You can combine these techniques to build more complex and efficient code.

```python
from collections import Counter

# Using list comprehensions, zip, and Counter together
data = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'apple']
counts = Counter([item for item in data])
print(counts)  # Output: Counter({'apple': 3, 'orange': 2, 'banana': 1})
```

### **14. Using `enumerate` for Index Tracking in Loops**

`enumerate` provides a counter for your iteration, allowing you to avoid manual index handling.

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

for index, name in enumerate(names):
    print(f"Index: {index}, Name: {name}")  # Output: Index: 0, Name: Alice, etc.
```
