**AWS Aurora Blue-Green Deployment** helps you create a staging environment (blue) that mirrors your production (green), and allows seamless switching between them. This is particularly useful for testing new database configurations, application updates, or migrations with minimal downtime.

### Overview
We will write:
1. **Script for Blue/Green Deployment**: Create and manage blue/green environments for Aurora.
2. **Monitoring Script**: Monitor the status of both blue and green environments.
3. **Testing Script**: Perform validation checks on the new environment before switching.

### Pre-requisites
1. Install `boto3` for AWS SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. Set up your AWS credentials and region via the AWS CLI or environment variables.

### 1. **Blue-Green Deployment Script**

This script will help you create a blue environment (a clone of your green production environment), run tests, and switch over traffic once you're confident the new setup works.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def create_blue_environment(source_cluster_identifier, blue_cluster_identifier):
    client = boto3.client('rds')

    try:
        response = client.restore_db_cluster_to_point_in_time(
            SourceDBClusterIdentifier=source_cluster_identifier,
            TargetDBClusterIdentifier=blue_cluster_identifier,
            UseLatestRestorableTime=True,
            DBClusterParameterGroupName='your-db-parameter-group',  # optional
            DBSubnetGroupName='your-db-subnet-group'  # optional
        )

        print(f"Blue environment {blue_cluster_identifier} created from {source_cluster_identifier}.")
        return response
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error creating blue environment: {e}")
        return None


def switch_traffic_to_blue(blue_cluster_identifier):
    client = boto3.client('rds')

    try:
        # Update your application to point to the blue environment by updating endpoints
        response = client.modify_db_cluster(
            DBClusterIdentifier=blue_cluster_identifier,
            ApplyImmediately=True,
            EndpointType='writer'  # Switching the blue environment to be the writer
        )
        print(f"Switched traffic to the blue environment {blue_cluster_identifier}.")
        return response
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error switching traffic to blue environment: {e}")
        return None

def delete_blue_environment(blue_cluster_identifier):
    client = boto3.client('rds')

    try:
        response = client.delete_db_cluster(
            DBClusterIdentifier=blue_cluster_identifier,
            SkipFinalSnapshot=True
        )
        print(f"Blue environment {blue_cluster_identifier} deleted.")
        return response
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error deleting blue environment: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with your green (production) cluster ID and blue (staging) cluster ID
    green_cluster_id = 'your-green-cluster-id'
    blue_cluster_id = 'your-blue-cluster-id'

    # 1. Create Blue Environment
    create_blue_environment(green_cluster_id, blue_cluster_id)

    # 2. After testing, switch traffic to blue
    # switch_traffic_to_blue(blue_cluster_id)

    # 3. If all is well, delete the blue environment after deployment
    # delete_blue_environment(blue_cluster_id)
```

### 2. **Monitoring Script for Blue/Green Environment**

This script will periodically monitor the status of both the blue (staging) and green (production) environments, allowing you to track their health and readiness.

```python
import boto3
import json
import time
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def get_cluster_status(cluster_identifier):
    client = boto3.client('rds')

    try:
        response = client.describe_db_clusters(
            DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_identifier
        )

        cluster_info = response['DBClusters'][0]
        instances_info = []

        # Get details of each instance in the cluster
        for instance in cluster_info['DBClusterMembers']:
            instance_status = {
                'DBInstanceIdentifier': instance['DBInstanceIdentifier'],
                'IsClusterWriter': instance['IsClusterWriter'],
                'DBInstanceStatus': instance['DBInstanceStatus']
            }
            instances_info.append(instance_status)

        status_info = {
            'ClusterIdentifier': cluster_info['DBClusterIdentifier'],
            'Status': cluster_info['Status'],
            'Endpoint': cluster_info['Endpoint'],
            'ReaderEndpoint': cluster_info.get('ReaderEndpoint', None),
            'Instances': instances_info
        }

        return json.dumps(status_info, indent=4)
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error fetching cluster status: {e}")
        return None

def monitor_periodically(green_cluster_id, blue_cluster_id, interval_seconds=60):
    while True:
        print("Monitoring Green Environment:")
        green_status_json = get_cluster_status(green_cluster_id)
        if green_status_json:
            print(green_status_json)

        print("\nMonitoring Blue Environment:")
        blue_status_json = get_cluster_status(blue_cluster_id)
        if blue_status_json:
            print(blue_status_json)

        # Wait for the next iteration
        time.sleep(interval_seconds)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with your cluster IDs
    green_cluster_id = 'your-green-cluster-id'
    blue_cluster_id = 'your-blue-cluster-id'

    # Monitor both environments
    monitor_periodically(green_cluster_id, blue_cluster_id, interval_seconds=60)
```

### 3. **Testing Script for Blue Environment**

Before switching traffic to the blue environment, itâ€™s crucial to perform various validation checks to ensure the new deployment is working correctly. This script can include basic tests like checking if the DB is accessible, running queries, etc.

```python
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import OperationalError

def test_blue_environment(blue_cluster_endpoint, db_name, username, password):
    try:
        connection = psycopg2.connect(
            host=blue_cluster_endpoint,
            database=db_name,
            user=username,
            password=password
        )
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        
        # Example test: Running a simple query
        cursor.execute("SELECT version();")
        db_version = cursor.fetchone()
        print(f"Connected to Blue Environment. Database version: {db_version[0]}")
        
        # Additional testing queries can go here...
        return True
    except OperationalError as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to Blue Environment: {e}")
        return False
    finally:
        if 'connection' in locals():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with your DB credentials and endpoint
    blue_cluster_endpoint = 'your-blue-cluster-endpoint'
    db_name = 'your-db-name'
    username = 'your-username'
    password = 'your-password'

    # Run the test
    if test_blue_environment(blue_cluster_endpoint, db_name, username, password):
        print("Blue environment testing succeeded.")
    else:
        print("Blue environment testing failed.")
```

### Workflow:

1. **Deployment**:
   - Run the **blue-green deployment script** to create the blue environment (`restore_db_cluster_to_point_in_time`).
   - Perform testing using the **testing script**.
   - If testing passes, switch traffic to the blue environment using the **switch_traffic_to_blue** function in the deployment script.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Continuously run the **monitoring script** to track the health and status of both environments.
   - This will allow you to see if any instance or environment is down or misconfigured.

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - If the deployment succeeds, remove the blue environment using the **delete_blue_environment** function.
   - If needed, revert traffic back to the green environment.

---

### Scheduling and Automation:
- **AWS Lambda** can trigger these scripts periodically (for monitoring) or based on specific events (like deployments).
- **CloudWatch Alarms** can be used to notify you if any issues arise during the deployment or testing phase.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate these scripts into your CI/CD pipelines to automate the creation, testing, and promotion of the blue environment.
