Continuing the JavaScript implementation, we need to handle adding notes, saving tasks and notes to `localStorage`, and removing tasks/notes. Here's the full JavaScript code:

```javascript
    function addNote(noteText) {
        const noteItem = document.createElement('li');
        noteItem.classList.add('note-item');
        noteItem.innerHTML = `
            <span>${noteText}</span>
            <button class="delete-note">Delete</button>
        `;
        noteList.appendChild(noteItem);

        // Delete note
        noteItem.querySelector('.delete-note').addEventListener('click', () => {
            noteItem.remove();
            removeNoteFromLocalStorage(noteText);
        });
    }

    // Save task to localStorage
    function saveTaskToLocalStorage(task) {
        let tasks = getTasksFromLocalStorage();
        tasks.push(task);
        localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
    }

    // Save note to localStorage
    function saveNoteToLocalStorage(note) {
        let notes = getNotesFromLocalStorage();
        notes.push(note);
        localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(notes));
    }

    // Load tasks from localStorage
    function loadTasks() {
        let tasks = getTasksFromLocalStorage();
        tasks.forEach(task => addTask(task));
    }

    // Load notes from localStorage
    function loadNotes() {
        let notes = getNotesFromLocalStorage();
        notes.forEach(note => addNote(note));
    }

    // Get tasks from localStorage
    function getTasksFromLocalStorage() {
        let tasks;
        if (localStorage.getItem('tasks') === null) {
            tasks = [];
        } else {
            tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks'));
        }
        return tasks;
    }

    // Get notes from localStorage
    function getNotesFromLocalStorage() {
        let notes;
        if (localStorage.getItem('notes') === null) {
            notes = [];
        } else {
            notes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes'));
        }
        return notes;
    }

    // Remove task from localStorage
    function removeTaskFromLocalStorage(taskText) {
        let tasks = getTasksFromLocalStorage();
        tasks = tasks.filter(task => task !== taskText);
        localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
    }

    // Remove note from localStorage
    function removeNoteFromLocalStorage(noteText) {
        let notes = getNotesFromLocalStorage();
        notes = notes.filter(note => note !== noteText);
        localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(notes));
    }
});
```

### Explanation of the Functions:

1. **addTask() and addNote()**:
   - These functions add a task or note to the UI, creating a list item (`<li>`) with a delete button for each task or note.
   - When the delete button is clicked, the task/note is removed from both the UI and `localStorage`.

2. **saveTaskToLocalStorage() and saveNoteToLocalStorage()**:
   - These functions save a new task or note into the browser's `localStorage`.
   - `localStorage` only supports storing strings, so tasks and notes are saved as JSON-encoded arrays.

3. **loadTasks() and loadNotes()**:
   - These functions load the tasks and notes from `localStorage` when the page is first loaded, ensuring they persist across sessions.

4. **getTasksFromLocalStorage() and getNotesFromLocalStorage()**:
   - These helper functions retrieve tasks and notes from `localStorage`, returning them as arrays. If no tasks or notes are found, they return empty arrays.

5. **removeTaskFromLocalStorage() and removeNoteFromLocalStorage()**:
   - These functions remove a task or note from `localStorage` when the corresponding delete button is clicked.

### Enhancements and Further Ideas:

1. **Task Completion**:
   - Add the ability to mark tasks as complete. You can toggle the `completed` class on the task text and update the task state in `localStorage`.

2. **Edit Functionality**:
   - Allow users to edit tasks and notes after they've been added.

3. **Search/Filter**:
   - Implement a search bar to allow users to filter tasks and notes based on keywords.

4. **Syncing with Server**:
   - If you plan to make this a more robust app, you could later add syncing capabilities with a server to allow for cross-device access.

5. **IndexedDB**:
   - If your task and note management grows more complex, consider migrating to `IndexedDB` for better performance and larger data storage.

### Conclusion:

This basic implementation provides a functional task and note tracker directly within a web browser. It leverages `localStorage` to store data, making it persistent between browser sessions, and can be extended with more features based on your requirements.
